# Welcome to Budget Tracker API

## Purpose

This simple platform was created for personal use, with the goal of refining and improving knowledge across several best practices: CI/CD, software engineering, observability, and security.

As an additional outcome, it provides a functional CRUD system designed to help manage day-to-day finances — keeping track of them to enable smarter decisions later on. This will become clearer once you reach the #architecture section.

As a “classical” REST API application, you can also use it as your personal backend for further studies. For instance, you might want to experiment with an MCP server using a real-world API (rather than the usual public JSON endpoints scattered across the internet) to learn from a realistic example.

The idea behind this app is to build features similar to what a simple finance spreadsheet could provide for personal use. If your goal is to actually manage your finances, it might be a better idea to just stick with a simple spreadsheet or a paid app.

!!! note "Proceed with learning purposes in mind"

    This app contains some overengineering throughout the ecosystem. It isn’t necessarily intended to be “production-ready” out of the box, but it aims to follow most production best practices.

## Target Audience

This application is aimed at technology enthusiasts and IT professionals. It’s not a SaaS application ready to be used directly from a public URL. Instead, it requires you to clone the repository and explore it locally before considering deploying your own instance.
