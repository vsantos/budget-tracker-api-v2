# Welcome to Budget Tracker API

## Purpose

This simple platform was created for personal purposes, to refine and improve knowledge among several best practices: CI/CD, software engineering, observability and security.

As an additional result, a functional CRUD is expected to help with our daily-basis finances - to keep track on them for allowing posterior smarter decisions. This will be clearer after you reah the #architecture section.

As a "classical" REST API application, you can use this application as your personal backend for posterior studies. Let's say you wanna explore a MCP server with a real-world API (not the usual JSON public endpoints spread the internet), so you can learn from a real world example.

## Target Audience

This application is aimed for technology enthusiasts and IT professionals, it's not a "saas" application ready to be used directly from a public URL. This project requires you to clone the repository and explore locally before thinking in serving your own platform.
